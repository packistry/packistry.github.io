# Introduction

Welcome to **Packistry**, a powerful, self-hosted Composer repository designed to simplify PHP package distribution. Whether you're managing private or public Composer repositories, Packistry offers robust tools for controlling access, managing updates, and integrating multiple source providers. With easy setup and support for platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea, Packistry puts you in charge of your PHP package management with only a few commands.

Packistry ensures seamless package updates through webhook integration, making it easier than ever to maintain the latest versions. This system allows developers to have full control over their packages, access management, and security, all within a self-hosted environment.

### Key Features

- **Private Repository Support**: Keep your sensitive or proprietary packages secure by hosting them in private repositories.

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Ensure secure access to your repositories with token-based authentication. This allows you to manage permissions for both users and automated systems (machines), providing granular control over who can view or modify your repositories.

- **Package Source Integration**: Easily manage and import Composer packages from various platforms:
  - **GitHub**
  - **GitLab**
  - **Gitea**

  Stay up to date automatically, as Packistry uses **webhooks** to pull the latest changes from your source repositories.

- **Comprehensive Repository Management**:
  - **Public/Private Repository Options**: Define repositories as public or private based on your project needs.
  - **Human Access Control**: Create user accounts to assign and manage access to your private repositories, ensuring only authorized individuals can interact with sensitive content.
  - **Machine Access Control**: Generate deploy tokens to allow machines (e.g., build systems or CI/CD pipelines) to access private repositories, ensuring smooth, secure automation.

Packistry combines ease of use, flexibility, and security to give you complete control over your PHP package distribution in a self-hosted environment. Whether you're managing a private project, a team of developers, or an open-source initiative, Packistry streamlines your workflow with minimal configuration and maximum control.
