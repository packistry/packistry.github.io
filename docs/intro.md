  - **Machine Access Control**: Generate deploy tokens to allow machines (e.g., build systems or CI/CD pipelines) to access private repositories, ensuring smooth, secure automation.

- **Authentication Sources**: Packistry supports **Single Sign-On (SSO)** through OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
  - **OpenID Connect**: Authenticate using an OIDC provider, such as Okta, Keycloak, or Microsoft Azure AD (Entra ID).
